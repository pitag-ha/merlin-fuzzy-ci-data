{1 QCheck compatibility package}


This library is there to ensure compatibility with QCheck 0.8 and earlier.

It has a unique module {!QCheck_runner} that merges the custom runners
from [qcheck-core.runner] ({!QCheck_base_runner})
and the OUnit runners from [qcheck-ounit] ({!QCheck_ounit})
into a single module.

By depending on [qcheck-core], this library also brings {!QCheck} in scope,
so it can be used transparently.
