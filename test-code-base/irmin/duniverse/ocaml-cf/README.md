## OCaml bindings to macOS CoreFoundation

These bindings use [ctypes](https://github.com/ocamllabs/ocaml-ctypes)
for type-safe stub generation.

### Dependent Packages

 - [ocaml-fsevents](https://github.com/mirage/ocaml-fsevents)

## History

This library is based on the [ocaml-osx-cf](https://github.com/dsheets/ocaml-osx-cf)
bindings originally written by David Sheets, and now renamed and maintained
by the MirageOS project.
