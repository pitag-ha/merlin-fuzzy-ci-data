### Awá SSH library.

[awa-ssh](http://www.github.com/haesbaert/awa-ssh) is an
_ISC-licensed_ SSH library implementation in ocaml.

The main goal is to provide a purely functional SSH implementation for embedding
in unikernels. This will allow us to have control SSH interfaces in
[mirage](https://mirage.io).

This is a work in progress software.

The name `awá` is a reference to the critically endangered indigenous people of
Brazil.
